# Dotdrop

[Dotdrop](https://deadc0de.re/dotdrop/) is a dotfiles manager that provides efficient ways to manage your dotfiles.
It is especially powerful when it comes to managing them across different hosts.

The idea of dotdrop is to have the ability to store each dotfile only once and deploy them with different
content on different hosts/setups.
To achieve this, it uses [Jinja2](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/), which is a templating engine that allows you to specify
during the dotfile installation how (with what content) each dotfile will be installed based on a selected profile.

Most information on using dotdrop is described in this documentation
and in the [readme](https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop/blob/master/README.md).
