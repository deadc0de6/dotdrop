# Dotdrop documentation

[Dotdrop](https://deadc0de.re/dotdrop/) is a dotfiles manager that provides efficient ways of managing your dotfiles.
It is especially powerful when it comes to managing those across different hosts..

The idea of dotdrop is to have the ability to store each dotfile only once and deploy them with a different content on different hosts/setups.
To achieve this, it uses [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) which is a templating engine that allows to specify
during the dotfile installation how (with what content) each dotfile will be installed based on a selected profile.

Most information on using dotdrop are described in this wiki and in the [readme](https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop/blob/master/README.md).
