# Dotdrop

[Dotdrop](https://deadc0de.re/dotdrop/) is a dotfiles manager that provides efficient
ways to manage your dotfiles.
It is especially powerful when it comes to managing those across different hosts.

The idea of dotdrop is to have the ability to store each dotfile only once and deploy
them with different content on different hosts/setups.

Most information on using dotdrop is described in this documentation
and in the [readme](https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop/blob/master/README.md).
