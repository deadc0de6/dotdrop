[Dotdrop](https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop) is a dotfile manager written in Python3
that provides efficient ways of managing your dotfiles. It is especially powerful when
it comes to managing those across different hosts.

* [✔] **VERSIONED**

  sure you are able to keep a history of your changes

* [✔] **GET QUICKLY STARTED**

* [✔] **NO DUPLICATES, EFFICIENT**

  Each dotfile is stored only once, dotdrop allows to template those
  such that the same dotfile is customized when deployed on the host you're working on

* [✔] **HANDLE MULTIPLE PROFILES**

  Different profiles can be defined that allows for a fine-grained control over which
  dotfiles has to be installed on different hosts (home, work, vps, etc)

* [✔] **GRANULARITY CONTROL OF EACH PROFILE**

  Some hosts/profiles will have all your dotfiles installed while others might just
  need a subset of the dotfiles

* [✔] **TO SYMLINK OR NOT TO SYMLINK**

  You can choose for each dotfile if you want it to be symlinked or
  directly copied to its final destination

* [✔] **POST DEPLOYMENT ACTION**

  Actions can be executed each time a specific dotfile is installed, for
  example to install a package, setup some directories, call a tool to update, etc

* [✔] **HANDLE SENSITIVE INFORMATION**

  Multiple solutions are available to handle dotfiles containing sensitive information
  as well as full encrypted dotfiles/rc files
